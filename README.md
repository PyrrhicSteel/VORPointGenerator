# Valkyries of Ran Unit Generator

Welcome! This program takes JSON imputs and converts them to statblocks for the Kantai Collection-Themed tabletop wargame Valkyries of Ran, whose ruleset is currently unpublished. Currently, documentation is dreadfully poor, the list of imputs is incredibly incomplete, the codebase is very shoddy, and balance testing is very, very far away, but this might be in a good enough state for someone to look at. I'm not certian.

## Requirements

Right now, there are no requirements that I am aware of.

## Installation

As a Microsoft Visual Studio project, the only confirmed installation method is through the 'Clone Git Repository' action in that IDE.

## Configuration

After setting up the visual studio project, ensure all json files have their 'Copy to Output Directory' option set to 'Copy Always.' The project should run from Program.cs after that.

## FAQ

Coming eventually...
